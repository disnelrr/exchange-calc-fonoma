# Fonoma - Frontend Developer Test

Complete this simple project to proceed with the hiring process.

We will review your implementation and provide feedback based on the quality of your solution.

Good luck!

## **Instructions**

1. [x] Create a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) basic project following this tutorial: [NextJS - getting started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).
2. [x] Create a git repository with the code and upload it to Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket.
3. [x] In the repository, create a new branch.
4. In the new branch, implement a simple exchange rate calculator, with the following characteristics:
    - An input field for the user to enter the amount to be converted.
    - Two dropdown menus for the user to select the currencies (from and to). You can obtain the list of available currencies from the API **[https://exchangeratesapi.io/](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)**.
    - A button to trigger the conversion.
    - An area to display the converted amount and exchange rate.

    **IMPORTANT:** Obtain the list of available currencies as well as the exchange rates using the following API: **[https://exchangeratesapi.io/](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).** The API provides 250 free requests per month; you just need to obtain an API key.

5. [x] Write at least one unit test. More unit tests, as well as snapshot tests, will give you bonus points.
6. Create a Pull Request (or Merge Request) of the new branch with a detailed description of the changes made.
7. [x] Deploy the project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): See [Introduction to Vercel | Vercel Docs](https://vercel.com/docs).
8. After completing the test and deploying the application, send us an email with the following links:
    - The link to the PR in your repository.
    - The link to the deployed version on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

[x] **Bonus points:** Implement a caching mechanism for the fetched exchange rates. For this, assume that the list of available currencies doesn’t change very often and that the exchange rate between two currencies has a validity of ten minutes.

[x] **Bonus points:** Use TypeScript.

**Bonus points:** Use styled-components
